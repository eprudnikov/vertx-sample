= Vertx-sample

This project demonstrates the implementation of common functionality using the reactive paradigm with Vert.x, focusing on database interaction, ORM integration, API exposure, and component wiring using a DI framework.

== To-Do List

* [ ] Connect to a PostgreSQL Database
** Setup a connection to a PostgreSQL database, ensuring reactive drivers are used for non-blocking I/O operations.

* [ ] Integrate Hibernate as ORM Framework
** [ ] Implement functionality to allow building flexible search criteria.
** [ ] Support fetching pageable results as well as streaming records to handle large datasets efficiently.

* [ ] Expose HTTP API
** [ ] Ensure the API supports pagination for efficient data retrieval.
** [ ] Implement server-sent events (SSE) to stream bulky results.

* [ ] Utilize a DI Framework for Component Wiring
** Incorporate a Dependency Injection (DI) framework to seamlessly wire components together, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
